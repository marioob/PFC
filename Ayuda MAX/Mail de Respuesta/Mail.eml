Dear Mario,

We definitely understand that the suggested "workaround" is tedious but=

given that you are the only customer who ever asked about this feature,=
 it
is unlikely to be included in our next ICP 2.3 release due to some othe=
r,
more requested updates. However, we recognize the importance of this
feature and we are going to implement it in the future.

Thanks a lot for your feedback!

Best Regards,
Vesna

Dear Vesna,

I followed your instructions, and finally I managed to add my own
customized Simulation Drivers.
However it took me quite a lot of of time to fill out every table with =
the
configurable settings.
I think this facility should be included in the next release of IVI
Compliance Package 2.3...

THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
=A1GRACIAS!

Yours,

instrument.drivers@ni.com escribi=F3:

I am sorry I haven't pointed that out in my email! You are correct Mari=
o:
The editing capabilities were added to IVI Compliance Package (ICP) 2.2=
 so
you should be able to follow my instructions after you update the ICP
version on your system.

Regards,
Vesna

Dear Vesna,

Sorry for disturbing you again.
I think I've found out what doesn't allow me to create a new SW module,=
 it
may be I have IVI Compliance Package 2.1 installed.

I have just read the following...
"IVI Compliance Package 2.2 includes the following new features:
=A0=A0=A0 -Instrument driver software module editing capabilities in th=
e IVI
Configuration Utility in MAX
=A0=A0=A0 -IVI Installer Creator
=A0=A0=A0 -IVI Specific Driver Test Suite".

So now, I am downloading v2.2, and will try to do it by myself again.
I hope it will work now!

Regards,
=A0=A0=A0 =A0=A0 =A0=A0 =A0=A0 =A0=A0 Marioinstrument.drivers@ni.com es=
cribi=F3:

Hello Mario,

Attached please find the modified copy of your XML file. I have added t=
he
"nisDCPwr_R" software module so I want to check if that is how you want=
 it
to be. Since you need to add 8 more simulation driver software modules,=
 I
will explain to you what you should do to add them yourself.

Note: This is just a workaround. We do not support editing of simulatio=
n
driver software modules at this time but we will consider implementing =
this
feature in one of future releases.

Steps to add a new simulation driver software module:

1. Open MAX and expand the Advanced>Instrument Driver Software Modules
section.
2. Create a new Software Module.
3. Fill out the following information:

      - General tab: Prefix, Module Path, Published APIs (all except fo=
r
NISimulationDriver 2.0)
      - Supported Modules and Physical Names tabs should stay empty
      - Configurable Settings tab: add manually one-by-one all configur=
able
settings publish by the corresponding simulation session. This means th=
at
you need to take a look at the existing class simulation driver session=
 and
add those configurable settings to your new software module. Add the na=
me
in the Name field, and copy the same name to the Software Module Key fi=
eld.
Leave the other fields empty.

4. Save IVI Configuration (use the button at the top).
5. Go back to the Published APIs field and add NISimulationDriver 2.0.
6. Save IVI Configuration again.
7. Refresh (F5). The software module should now show up under the
Simulation Driver Software Modules.

I hope this makes sense. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regards,
Vesna

I'd swear I attached it, didn't just copy and paste.
I think it's just the previos visualization that comes with your mail
client.
Anyway, I'm sending you now 2 files:
-"IviConfigurationStore.xml"
-"IviConfigurationStore.zip", the same as above but zipped, so that it
doesn't look as if I had just copied it.

Thanks again!

Mario,

Could you please send me your IviConfigurationStore.xml file as an
attachment instead of pasting the content of this file in the email?

Thanks,
Vesna

Dear Vesna:

With reference to the message I posted here (
http://forums.ni.com/ni/board/message?board.id=3D140&message.id=3D9942 =
) in
the Instrument Control Discussion Forum, could you please modify my
"IviConfigurationStore.xml" file for me?

I'm attaching 11 files in this mail:
-my file located in C:\Program Files\IVI\Data :
"IviConfigurationStore.xml" .
-one picture called "OldConfig.jpg" which shows the old configuration
with the original simulation driver software modules included in IVI
Driver Toolset 2.0
-nine pictures called "NewConfig_*.jpg" which represent my new desired
configuration with my customized  simulation driver software modules an=
d
DLLs.

I think this way it is very clear what I want from my new configuration=

file.
If you have any doubt, don't hesitate to ask me.

Thanks a million for your help!!!

Best regards,
                       Mario
